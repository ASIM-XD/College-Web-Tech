    <p>
        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, and I specialize in front-end web development.
        Over the past couple of years, I've been working on real-world projects and exploring technologies like HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and frameworks such as React and Bootstrap. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and
        intuitive designs.
    </p>

    <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
    <p>
        I believe technology should make life easier, and I'm driven by the idea of building digital solutions that help people.
        Whether it's a small website or a full-scale application, my goal is to create seamless user experiences and clean,
        maintainable code.
    </p>

    <h3>Core Values</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Curiosity:</b> Always eager to learn new things and improve existing skills.</li>
        <li><b>Collaboration:</b> I value working with others, sharing knowledge, and growing together.</li>
        <li><b>Quality:</b> I aim for precision in both code and design to deliver professional results.</li>
        <li><b>Consistency:</b> Continuous improvement is more important than quick success.</li>
    </ul>
